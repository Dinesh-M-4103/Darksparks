Global Electronics Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
Project Overview
This project involves conducting a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Global Electronics, a leading retailer of consumer electronics. The primary objective is to derive actionable insights from the company's data to enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and drive business growth. The analysis will focus on customer behavior, product performance, sales trends, store operations, and the impact of currency exchange rates on international sales.
Problem Statement
Global Electronics has provided several datasets containing information about customers, products, sales, stores, and currency exchange rates. The goal is to analyze these datasets to identify key insights that can improve marketing strategies, optimize inventory management, and enhance sales forecasting. By doing so, the company aims to:
•	Tailor marketing campaigns and promotions.
•	Improve product development.
•	Optimize inventory allocation.
•	Plan store expansions and optimizations.
•	Develop effective pricing strategies for international markets.
Approach
The project will follow a systematic approach to ensure thorough data analysis and insightful outcomes:
1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
•	Check for Missing Values: Identify and handle any missing values in the datasets.
•	Data Type Conversion: Convert data types where necessary (e.g., dates and numerical values).
•	Merge Datasets: Combine datasets for comprehensive analysis (e.g., linking sales data with product and customer information).
2. Data Loading
•	SQL Database Integration: Insert the preprocessed data into an SQL database by creating relevant tables for each data source and using SQL INSERT statements to load the data.
3. SQL Query Development
•	10 SQL Queries: Formulate and execute 10 SQL queries to extract key insights from the data. These queries will address important business questions, such as sales trends, top-selling products, and customer purchase behavior.
4. Data Visualization
•	Power BI/Tableau Dashboards: Connect the SQL database to Power BI or Tableau and create interactive dashboards. These visualizations will help stakeholders explore the data and understand the key insights in a user-friendly format.
Business Use Cases
The insights derived from this project will be used to:
1.	Optimize Marketing Strategies: Identify customer segments for targeted marketing and design effective promotional campaigns.
2.	Improve Inventory Management: Enhance inventory planning by predicting product demand and reducing overstock/stockout scenarios.
3.	Enhance Sales Forecasting: Use historical sales data to make accurate sales predictions and improve financial planning.
4.	Make Data-Driven Store Decisions: Decide on store expansions, closures, or layout optimizations based on store performance data.
5.	Refine International Pricing Strategies: Adjust pricing strategies by understanding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on sales.
Tools and Technologies
•	Python: For data cleaning, preparation, and preliminary analysis.
•	SQL: For data storage, retrieval, and running analytical queries.
•	Power BI/Tableau: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.
•	Microsoft Excel: For preliminary data exploration and visualization (optional).
